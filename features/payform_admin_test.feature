@payform

Feature: payform admin
  In order to manage payforms
  As an admin
  I want to be able to approve, print, and perform other administrative tasks for payforms

  Background:
    Given the user "Albus" "Dumledore" has permissions "payform regular user, payform administrator"
    And I am "Albus" "Dumbledore"
    And I have the following payforms:
      | date       | department | user_first | user_last      | submitted | approved |printed|
