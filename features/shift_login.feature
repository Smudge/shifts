        Given I am not logged into a shift
        When I am on shifts page
        Then I should not see "Return to current shift"

        And I press "Add this event"        
        #this step might fail if done at exactly the wrong moment 
        Then the current time should appear 
        And I should see "Hey, I am here!"
